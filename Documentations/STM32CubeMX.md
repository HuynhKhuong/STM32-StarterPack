# STM32CubeMX

Some notes to take into account if you're generating setups in STM32CubeMX

Firstly, STM32CubeMX is frequently updated and modified by ST engineers. I appreciate that effort to bring new features and fix reported flaws in their products. However, new updates always come with new errors and i prefer the stability in usage. Therefore, sometimes it's better to use old packages. You should keep your favourite package and constantly use it in projects. 

Here are some links for tutorial to keep in mind:

1. Your firmware package is in the Repository directory
