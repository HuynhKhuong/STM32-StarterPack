# STM32-StarterPack
I just started studying embedded coding on STM32 via STM32F407VG, many mistakes may be caused and i want to record all my mistakes as a cheatsheet for later projects.
This Repository contains all my mistakes in all peripherals initializaion and usage, my notes for solution and my guide for Setting on STM32CubeMX, and (maybe) knowledges before starting.
