Note: 
DMAcplt -> fires the 
UART DMA in Normal mode without interrupts, 
HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA always returns HAL_BUSY after the first use. 


A quick debug session shows that in subsequent calls to HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA, 
the functions immediately returns HAL_BUSY because huart->gState != HAL_UART_STATE_READY. 
This is the case because UART_DMATransmitCplt relies on the USART interrupt to be enabled 
to reset huart->gState to HAL_UART_STATE_READY

Another way to solve this is to enable USART global interrupt.
